project: Python Principles; Consecutive Zeros
metadoc: The goal of this challenge is to analyze a binary string consisting of only zeros and ones.
         Your code should find the biggest number of consecutive zeros in the string. For example, given the string:
         - "1001101000110"
         The biggest number of consecutive zeros is 3.
